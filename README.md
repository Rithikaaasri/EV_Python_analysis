# EV Growth Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) over the years using Python. The dataset provides insights into the increasing adoption of EVs and helps visualize trends using various charts.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Clean and analyze EV adoption data.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to illustrate the trends in EV growth.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Utilize maps to analyze EV density (if applicable).

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib folium pywaffle
```

## How to Run
1. Open `EVcars.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the cells step by step to process the data and generate insights.
3. Modify the dataset or visualization settings as needed.

## Interpretation of the Growth Chart
The provided line graph depicts the **exponential growth** of electric vehicles from 2017 to 2024. Key observations:
- The number of EVs has **steadily increased** each year.
- Growth appears **exponential**, with a significant rise after 2020.
- The highest surge in EV adoption is observed between **2022 and 2024**.

This trend indicates increasing consumer adoption, government incentives, and technological advancements contributing to the EV market expansion.

## Hypothesis
We hypothesize that:
1. **Government Policies**: Incentives and regulations have positively influenced EV adoption.
2. **Infrastructure Growth**: Expansion of charging stations has encouraged more people to buy EVs.
3. **Technology Advancements**: Improvements in battery life and affordability have accelerated adoption rates.

## Future Scope
- Incorporate more datasets to analyze **regional trends**.
- Predict future EV adoption using **machine learning models**.
- Study the impact of **policy changes** on EV growth.
